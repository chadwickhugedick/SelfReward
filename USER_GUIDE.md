## 🎯 Overview & Concept

### What is SRDDQN?
**Self-Rewarding Double Deep Q-Network (SRDDQN)** is an advanced AI trading system that learns to trade stocks by **teaching itself what good trading rewards look like**. Unlike traditional systems that use fixed reward rules, SRDDQN combines:

- **Expert Knowledge**: Traditional trading metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Min-Max, Returns)
- **Self-Learning**: AI that predicts its own rewards and gets better over time
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: AI that learns optimal trading strategies through trial and error

### The Big Idea (From the Research Paper)
The paper introduces a **two-phase learning system**:

1. **Phase 1 (Pre-training)**: The AI learns from expert trading knowledge
2. **Phase 2 (RL Training)**: The AI uses both expert knowledge AND its own predictions to make trading decisions

**Key Innovation**: At each trading step, the system compares the expert-defined reward with its own predicted reward and **chooses the higher one**. This ensures the AI always learns from the best available signal.

## 🔧 Module Explanations

### 1. Trading Environment (`src/environment/trading_env.py`)
**What it does**: Simulates the stock market for training

**Key Features**:
- Loads historical stock data (OHLC + Volume)
- Adds position information (whether you currently own stock)
- Calculates trading rewards using expert formulas
- Tracks portfolio value, trades, and performance metrics

**Think of it as**: Your virtual stock market where the AI practices trading

**Input**: Stock price data
**Output**: Market states, rewards, trading results

### 2. SRDDQN Agent (`src/models/agents/srddqn.py`)
**What it does**: The main AI trader that makes buy/sell/hold decisions

**Key Features**:
- **Double DQN**: Uses two neural networks to avoid overestimating rewards
- **State Buffer**: Remembers the last 20 market states for context
- **Action Selection**: Chooses optimal trading actions
- **Self-Reward Computation**: Predicts its own reward for each action
- **Reward Caching**: Speeds up training by remembering similar situations

**Think of it as**: The AI trader's "brain" that decides when to buy, sell, or hold

### 3. Reward Network (`src/models/reward_net/reward_network.py`)
**What it does**: Learns to predict trading rewards like an expert

**Key Features**:
- Takes market sequences + actions as input
- Uses advanced time-series models (TimesNet, NLinear, WFTNet)
- Outputs predicted reward for each possible action
- Gets trained to match expert-defined rewards

**Think of it as**: The AI's "intuition" about what makes a good trade

### 4. Feature Extraction Models (`src/models/feature_extraction/`)

#### TimesNet (`timesnet.py`)
- **Best for**: Complex time-series patterns, highest accuracy
- **Speed**: Slower (2+ minutes per episode)
- **Use when**: You want maximum trading performance
- **Architecture**: Complex temporal convolutions with Inception blocks

#### NLinear (`nlinear.py`) 
- **Best for**: Fast training, good performance
- **Speed**: Very fast (~20 seconds per episode)
- **Use when**: You want quick experimentation or have limited compute
- **Architecture**: Simple linear layers with normalization

#### WFTNet (`wftnet.py`)
- **Best for**: Balance between speed and accuracy
- **Speed**: Medium
- **Use when**: You want a middle ground option

**Think of them as**: Different "lenses" the AI uses to analyze market patterns

### 5. Training Pipeline

#### Pre-training (`src/pretrain_reward_network.py`)
**What it does**: Teaches the Reward Network to mimic expert trading knowledge

**Process**:
1. Generate expert-labeled trading examples
2. Train the Reward Network to predict these expert rewards
3. Save the trained network for RL training

#### RL Training (`src/train.py`)
**What it does**: Trains the SRDDQN agent using self-rewarding mechanism

**Process**:
1. Agent takes action in market
2. Calculate expert reward (formula-based)
3. Calculate self-predicted reward (Reward Network)
4. Choose max(expert_reward, self_reward) as final reward
5. Update both the agent and reward network

```

### Model Selection
```yaml
model:
  reward_net:
    model_type: "NLinear"      # Options: TimesNet, WFTNet, NLinear
    hidden_size: 32            # Network size (bigger = more complex)
    num_layers: 1              # Network depth
```

### Training Parameters
```yaml
training:
  num_episodes: 20             # How many trading episodes
  batch_size: 16               # Training batch size

## 🔄 Model Switching Guide

### **IMPORTANT**: Reward Network Compatibility

**YES, you need to retrain rewards when switching feature extraction models!**

Here's why:

1. **Different architectures** → Different internal representations
2. **Different input/output dimensions** → Incompatible model weights
3. **Different feature patterns** → Different learning characteristics

### Switching from NLinear to TimesNet:

#### Step 1: Update Configuration
```yaml
model:
  reward_net:
    model_type: "TimesNet"     # Changed from NLinear
    hidden_size: 64            # Increase for complex model
    num_layers: 2              # Increase layers
```

#### Step 2: Delete Old Reward Network
```bash
rm models/saved/pretrained_reward_network.pth
```

#### Step 3: Retrain Everything
```bash
python main.py --pretrain    # Retrain reward network with TimesNet
python main.py --train       # Retrain SRDDQN agent
```

### Why This Happens:
- **TimesNet**: Uses complex Inception blocks and temporal convolutions
- **NLinear**: Uses simple linear transformations
- **Incompatible weights**: Can't load TimesNet weights into NLinear structure

### Time Investment:
- **NLinear**: ~10 seconds pre-training + ~2 minutes RL training
- **TimesNet**: ~5 minutes pre-training + ~10 minutes RL training

```bash
rm models/saved/pretrained_reward_network.pth
rm models/saved/srddqn_model.pth
python main.py --pretrain --train
```

#### 2. Training is very slow
**Cause**: Using TimesNet with large batch sizes
**Solutions**:
- Switch to NLinear in config

## 📈 Understanding the Self-Rewarding Concept

### Traditional RL:
```
Action → Environment → Fixed Reward → Learning
```

### Self-Rewarding RL (SRDDQN):
```
Action → Environment → Expert Reward
                    ↘
                     Compare & Choose Max → Learning
                    ↗
        Reward Network → Self Reward
```

### Key Benefits:
1. **Adaptive**: Reward function evolves with experience
2. **Robust**: Always uses the best available reward signal
3. **Expert-Guided**: Incorporates domain knowledge
4. **Self-Improving**: Gets better at predicting rewards over time

This creates a **positive feedback loop** where better reward predictions lead to better trading, which generates better training data, which improves reward predictions!
